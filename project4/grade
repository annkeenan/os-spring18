level 1 correctness: 

properly processing multiple files > 64MB: program won't finish after 45 minutes (running pcap Big and pcap Medium with optimal number of threads). [-7.5]

level 2 correctness:

works on most files, some inaccurate results: for two medium files at level 2, the redundency rates is detected to be around 14%, which is too far away from 50%. On the other hand two small files get 44% which is about right. This indicates ineffective eviction strategy in the level 2 design. [-2.5]

overall correctness: 
30/40

Robustness: 
16/18
When file is in the wrong format or does not exist, the program won't exit even though it detects the wrong file situations. [-2]

documentation:
12/12
performance for level1 and 2 should be expressed in KB/s format. [-2]



competitive grade: 2.5
overall: 80.5
